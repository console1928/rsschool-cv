Summary
---------

It's been two years since I changed my profession and started working as a frontend developer.

Recently, I decided to take a break from my job and improve my knowledge of frontend technologies, so my current activities include repeating basic things about JavaScript, HTML CSS and learning how to build some algorithms.

After that I plan on to find new, more interesting job.
